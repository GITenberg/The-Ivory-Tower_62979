description: '"One of the two novels which Henry James left unfinished at his death
  ... designed to consist of ten books. Three only of these were written, with one
  chapter of the fourth, and except for the correction of a few obvious slips the
  fragment is here printed in full and without alteration ... The pages of preliminary
  notes, also here printed in full, were not of course intended for publication."--Preface
  (signed: Percy Lubbock)'
